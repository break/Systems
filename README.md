Assignment 0: Data Sorter

In this assignment, we implemented a mergesort on an imdb csv file. We dynamically allocated memory for all the individual rows,
however, the columns are static. We previously knew the names of the columns, so we implemented a struct of columns and held 
the rows in a pointer to all the struct movies.
